```markdown
### 3. Set up Firebase

- Create a [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Enable Authentication (email/password)
- Enable Cloud Firestore
- Get your Firebase config and add to `src/firebase.js`:

```js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  // ...your config here
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);

### 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev

## üìù Key Implementation Details

- **Authentication:**  
  Firebase Auth handles secure user login/registration. After sign-up, a user document is auto-created in the Firestore `users` collection.

- **Firestore as Backend:**  
  - `products` collection: All product CRUD (add/edit/delete/fetch) happens directly with Firestore.
  - `orders` collection: Every checkout is stored with user info, items, and totals.
  - `users` collection: Profile CRUD (edit name, address, delete account).
  - All updates are real-time!

- **Redux Toolkit:**  
  - Cart state and operations are global and persistent (sessionStorage).
  - Product, order, and auth slices for scalable management.

- **UI/UX:**  
  - All design with MUI, matching modern e-commerce feel.
  - Responsive layout, mobile-ready, beautiful snackbars & modals.
  - "Add to cart" shows a snackbar; empty cart message is big and clear.
  - "Scroll to top" floating button for better UX.

- **Dark Mode:**  
  - Global dark mode toggle; app bar and all backgrounds switch smoothly.

## üõí Sample Product Data (for Firestore)

You can add products in the Firebase console under `products`:

```json
{
  "name": "Oreo Cookies",
  "description": "Classic chocolate sandwich cookies with a sweet cream filling.",
  "price": 2.99,
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505250469679-203ad9ced0cb?auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80"
